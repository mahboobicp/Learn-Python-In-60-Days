""" Coding Exercise 1
We have a list of three strings defined in the code area.

Extend the code so your program prints out the following out of that list:

0-Document.txt
1-Report.txt
2-Presentation.txt """

filenames = ['document', 'report', 'presentation']
for i,j in enumerate(filenames):
    print(f"{i}-{j.capitalize()}.txt")
